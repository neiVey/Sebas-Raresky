 <h1>Sebas Raresky: The Fallen Angel</h1>
 <p> Old fallen angel who was betrayed for his brother Jesus. In the time of Jesus he was one of the best second hand of his brother but when his brother didn't want him to serve the empire with him, his heart full of hate and envy tried to kill Jesus.
  As Jesus noticed his plans he sent him somewhere he couldnt get back, to the Hell. For his honor now, when you see a rainbow going down after every storm, means when Jesus sent Sebas to hell. </p>
